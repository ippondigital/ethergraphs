ethers-cli
==========

The ethers.io command line interface for signing and uploading content to the ethers.space domain
for use with the ethers.io application container.

@TODO: This is still very early in development and many things don't work yet. This documentation
is how things *will* work (probably)


Starting a New Project
----------------------

```
# If you do not already have a git project
/Users/ethers> git init

/Users/ethers> ethers init
Password: *****
Confirm Password: *****
```

Development
-----------

The `--live` option will serve all files in the directory, regardless of their
state in git.

This will automatically open a browser window, serving your application using a self-signed
certificate. You must accept this certificate in order to see your locally hosted app.

```
/Users/ethers> ethers serve --live
```

As you make changes, you can refresh your browser (or just the inner frame) to see the results.


Preparing for Production
------------------------

All files must be committed to git to publish.

```
/Users/ethers> ethers prepare
Finding files...
/ ...
Preparing unsigned slug: ...

/Users/ethers> ethers serve
Found prepared slug: ...
```

Pushing to Production
---------------------

```
/Users/ethers> ethers push
Found prepared slug: ...
Password: *****
```
